## School District Analysis Challenge Report Findings
   In this challenge, we took student level standardized test scores in both reading and math for all high schools in a city school district and analyized the data at several levels to provide insights about performance trends and patterns.  From this analysis we discovered a few things.

   When comparing school budgets between charter and public high schools in the district, there was only a small difference between the average school budget (Charter Schools - $872,626 vs. Public Schools - $911,196), thus any testing differences would not likely be due to the district funding public and charter schools differently.
   
   When comparing math and reading scores between charter and public high schools in the district, the average reading scores were nearly identical (~72), while the average math scores did show a meaningful difference across all grades with charter schools outscoring public schools by almost 4 points.  Drilling down into each grade, on average, the charter schools out scored the public schools in all grades (9th-+6, 10th-+2, 11th-+9), except 12th grade(12th-+4).
   
   Looking further, in the future, we might want to examine test scores by individual high school budgets to see if any particular schools are responsible for the test discrepancies and whether there local budgets play a role.  In addition, we might want to cross reference the test scores with the size of the schools to see if any patterns exist to explain test score differences across the district.
